## Overview

This pipeline follows these steps:

1. **Generation**:  
   Your Cython source code (e.g. `fizzbuzz.pyx`) is placed in `code/cython`. This file represents code generated by your upstream process.

2. **Indexing**:  
   The build/run process uses an incrementing index (starting at 5, then 10, 15, â€¦) to group related build and run outputs. The current index is stored in `code/cython/index/next.txt`.

3. **Build Phase**:  
   - The build container mounts the generated code directory.
   - It copies the `.pyx` file into its working directory, compiles it using a `setup.py` script, and produces a shared object file.
   - The build logs, metadata, and compiled artifact are saved to `code/cython/index/<INDEX>/build`.

4. **Run Phase**:  
   - The run container mounts the same directory (under a different mount point) so it can access the compiled artifact.
   - It imports the compiled module and executes a test run (calling the `fizzbuzz` function).
   - Run logs and metadata are saved to `code/cython/index/<INDEX>/run`.

5. **Orchestration**:  
   The top-level `run.sh` script coordinates the process by reading/updating the index and invoking the build and run containers sequentially.

## How to Run

1. **Prerequisites**:  
   - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.
   - Your generated `fizzbuzz.pyx` must be in `code/cython`.

2. **Build the Docker Images (Optional)**:  
   You can pre-build the images using:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
